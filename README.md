# Hi, I'm Robin Thun 

**IT Engineering Student @ Arcada UAS · Helsinki, Finland**

I'm a frontend-focused developer seeking internship/trainee opportunities. I enjoy building practical applications and exploring algorithms, data, and user-facing interfaces. I'm well-versed in working with AI tools and eager to apply them in real-world projects — whether that's integrating AI into applications or using it to accelerate development.
